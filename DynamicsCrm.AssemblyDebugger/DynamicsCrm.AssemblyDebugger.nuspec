    <!-- Any details about this particular release -->
    <releaseNotes>First release version. Compiled with .net 4.5.2, Sdk 8.0. Should work with all next versions. Tested also with 4.6.1/9.0.
                  
                  Only known issue: with some assembly projects, CrmServiceClient needs to be reinitialized after Plugin/Code activitity is executed. 
                  If this happens, just add something like this to your project between calls of *Executor.Execute: "yourCrmServiceClient = new CrmServiceClient(yourConnectionString)"
